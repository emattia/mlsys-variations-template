# üîç Naming Migration Completeness Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide ensures **100% naming migration completeness** when changing platform names. Whether you're a developer or an AI assistant working on this platform, follow these procedures to guarantee that all naming changes are applied consistently across the entire codebase.

## üéØ **Complete Migration Workflow**

### **Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis**
```bash
# Get comprehensive analysis of current naming state
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py analyze

# Check specific file patterns
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py discover

# Validate current naming consistency
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py validate
```

**Expected Output:** Detailed report showing all naming patterns, affected files, and current consistency score.

### **Step 2: Choose Migration Strategy**
```bash
# Option A: MLX Platform (ML-focused branding)
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset mlx

# Option B: MLSys Platform (Systems-focused branding)
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset mlsys

# Option C: Custom Platform (your own branding)
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset custom:yourname
```

### **Step 3: Preview Changes (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# ALWAYS preview first to see what will be changed
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py migrate --dry-run

# Check integration points that might be affected
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py validate --detailed
```

**Critical Check:** Ensure the preview shows all expected files and changes align with your intentions.

### **Step 4: Execute Migration**
```bash
# Apply the migration with automatic backups
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py migrate --apply

# Alternative: Use MLX Assistant for guided migration
mlx assistant naming migrate --preset mlx --apply
```

### **Step 5: Comprehensive Validation**
```bash
# Full completeness validation
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py validate --detailed

# Test platform functionality
python scripts/test_naming_system.py

# MLX Assistant validation with intelligent feedback
mlx assistant naming validate --detailed
```

## üî¨ **Migration Completeness Checklist**

### **Files That MUST Be Updated**
- [ ] **Main Configuration**: `mlx.config.json` ‚Üí `{platform}.config.json`
- [ ] **CLI Scripts**: `mlx` ‚Üí `{platform}` (main script)
- [ ] **Component Directories**: `mlx-components/` ‚Üí `{platform}-components/`
- [ ] **Docker Configuration**: `docker-compose.yml` network names
- [ ] **Package Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` script entries
- [ ] **Documentation**: All `.md` files with platform references
- [ ] **Source Code**: All `.py` files with hardcoded names
- [ ] **Configuration Files**: All `.yml`/`.yaml` files
- [ ] **Test Files**: All test files with platform references

### **Critical Integration Points**
- [ ] **CI/CD Workflows**: `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- [ ] **Docker Networks**: Network names in compose files
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Service names and routes
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Plugin naming conventions
- [ ] **CLI Command Names**: All command-line interfaces
- [ ] **Import Statements**: Python module imports
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Platform-specific env vars

### **Validation Metrics**
- [ ] **Consistency Score**: ‚â•95% (excellent)
- [ ] **File Coverage**: All critical files found and updated
- [ ] **Pattern Consistency**: No old naming patterns detected
- [ ] **CLI Functionality**: All commands work with new names
- [ ] **Integration Points**: All integrations properly updated

## ü§ñ **For AI Assistants & LLMs**

### **Essential Commands for AI Agents**
```bash
# 1. Always start with analysis
mlx assistant naming status

# 2. Validate before any changes
mlx assistant naming validate

# 3. Use guided migration
mlx assistant naming migrate --dry-run
mlx assistant naming migrate --apply

# 4. Verify completeness
mlx assistant naming validate --detailed
```

### **AI Decision Framework**
1. **Analyze Current State**: Use `mlx assistant naming status` to understand current configuration
2. **Assess Consistency**: Check consistency score - if <90%, migration needed
3. **Choose Strategy**: MLX (ML-focused), MLSys (systems-focused), or custom
4. **Preview Impact**: Always use `--dry-run` first to understand changes
5. **Apply & Validate**: Execute migration and immediately validate results
6. **Provide Feedback**: Use validation results to inform user of completeness

### **AI Warning Signs**
üö® **Stop and investigate if you see:**
- Consistency score below 70%
- Missing critical files (CLI scripts, config files)
- CLI commands failing after migration
- Integration points showing errors
- Any mention of "manual intervention required"

## üìä **Understanding Validation Results**

### **Consistency Score Interpretation**
```
95-100%: ‚úÖ Excellent - Production ready
85-94%:  ‚ö†Ô∏è Good - Minor issues remain
70-84%:  üîÑ Needs Work - Significant inconsistencies
<70%:    ‚ùå Poor - Major problems, review required
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **File Coverage Issues**
```
Issue: "Main CLI script not found"
Solution: Manually rename the CLI script file
Command: mv mlx {new_platform_name}
```

#### **Pattern Consistency Issues**
```
Issue: "Found old naming patterns in 5 files"
Solution: Re-run migration or manual fixes
Command: python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py migrate --apply
```

#### **CLI Functionality Issues**
```
Issue: "CLI commands failing"
Solution: Check script permissions and imports
Commands:
  chmod +x {new_cli_name}
  python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

#### **Integration Issues**
```
Issue: "Docker network names inconsistent"
Solution: Update docker-compose.yml manually
Check: All service definitions use new network name
```

## üîß **Advanced Troubleshooting**

### **Manual File Updates**
Sometimes files require manual intervention:

```bash
# Find all remaining old patterns
grep -r "oldname" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.venv

# Update specific files manually
sed -i 's/oldname/newname/g' problematic_file.py

# Check import statements
python -c "import problematic_module"
```

### **Custom Validation Rules**
Add custom validation for your specific needs:

```python
# In scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py
def _check_custom_patterns(self, file_path: Path, content: str):
    """Add your custom validation patterns here"""
    custom_checks = [
        ("your_old_pattern", "Should be updated to your_new_pattern"),
        # ... add more
    ]
    # Implementation details...
```

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **Migration is Complete When:**
‚úÖ **Validation Score**: ‚â•95% consistency
‚úÖ **File Coverage**: All critical files found and updated
‚úÖ **CLI Functional**: All commands work with new names
‚úÖ **Tests Pass**: `python scripts/test_naming_system.py` succeeds
‚úÖ **Integration Works**: Docker, CI/CD, etc. all functional
‚úÖ **No Warnings**: Validation shows no critical issues

### **Post-Migration Best Practices**
1. **Test All Workflows**: Run through major platform workflows
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all docs reflect new naming
3. **Inform Team**: Update team on new CLI commands and patterns
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check for any missed references in logs/usage
5. **Regular Validation**: Periodically run validation to catch drift

## üö® **Emergency Rollback**

If migration fails or causes issues:

```bash
# Restore from automatic backups
find . -name "*.backup" -exec sh -c 'mv "$1" "${1%.backup}"' _ {} \;

# Reset naming configuration
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset mlx  # or original preset

# Validate rollback
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py validate
```

## üìû **Getting Help**

### **Diagnostic Commands**
```bash
# Full system health check
mlx assistant doctor

# Detailed naming analysis
mlx assistant naming validate --detailed --fix

# Interactive troubleshooting
mlx assistant interactive
```

### **Common Support Scenarios**

**Q: Migration seems stuck at 85% consistency**
**A:** This often indicates manual file renaming needed. Check validation details for specific files requiring attention.

**Q: CLI commands not working after migration**
**A:** Check script permissions and Python path. Recreate virtual environment if needed.

**Q: Docker services failing with new names**
**A:** Update docker-compose.yml network names and rebuild containers.
