## üéØ Mission: MLX Platform Enhancement & Naming Consistency Resolution

You are taking over a **mature MLX Platform Foundation** that now has a **complete naming migration system**. Your mission is to resolve the current naming inconsistencies and enhance the platform's capabilities.

## üìã Current State Overview

### ‚úÖ **What's Already Built (COMPLETE)**
- **Comprehensive naming migration system** with 100% test coverage
- **Platform-wide configuration management** (`scripts/naming_config.py`)
- **Automated migration tools** for 40+ files across the codebase
- **Rich CLI interfaces** with progress tracking and safety features
- **Complete documentation** and user guides
- **930 naming inconsistencies identified** across 33 files

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issue: Naming Inconsistencies**
The platform currently has **mixed naming** that creates confusion:
- Main CLI: `mlsys` vs Platform: `mlx`
- Evaluation CLI: `mlx-eval` vs Main CLI: `mlsys`  
- Docker network: `mlsys-network` vs Components: `mlx-components`
- Config file: `mlx.config.json` vs Template: `mlsys-variations-template`

**This must be resolved first** before any new features are added.

## üéØ Your Primary Objectives

### **Phase 1: Resolve Naming Inconsistencies (CRITICAL)**
1. **Choose a naming strategy** and apply it platform-wide
2. **Test the migration** thoroughly to ensure no breakage
3. **Validate all systems** work after the naming change
4. **Update any remaining references** not caught by automation

### **Phase 2: Platform Enhancement**
1. **Enhance the AI evaluation system** with additional capabilities
2. **Improve the MLX component ecosystem** 
3. **Add new platform features** that leverage the consistent naming
4. **Integrate naming consistency** into CI/CD pipeline

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools & Resources

### **Naming Migration System**
```bash
# Analysis tools
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py analyze          # See all inconsistencies
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py discover         # List affected files
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py migrate --dry-run # Preview changes

# Migration options (choose one)
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset mlx --apply      # MLX everywhere
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset mlsys --apply    # MLSys everywhere  
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset custom:NAME --apply # Custom name

# Validation
python scripts/test_naming_system.py                       # Test entire system
python -m pytest tests/test_naming_migration.py -v        # Unit tests
```

### **Documentation Available**
- `docs/naming-configuration-guide.md` - Complete user guide
- `docs/naming-system-implementation-summary.md` - Technical overview
- `scripts/naming_config.py` - Core configuration system
- `tests/test_naming_migration.py` - Test examples

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### **Step 1: Analyze Current State**
```bash
# Get the full picture
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py analyze
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py discover
```

### **Step 2: Choose Naming Strategy**
Based on the analysis, pick the most appropriate option:

**Option A: MLX Platform** (Recommended for ML focus)
- Consistent `mlx` naming across all components
- Commands: `mlx assistant`, `mlx-eval`
- Files: `mlx.config.json`, `mlx-components/`

**Option B: MLSys Platform** (Recommended for systems focus)  
- Consistent `mlsys` naming across all components
- Commands: `mlsys assistant`, `mlsys-eval`
- Files: `mlsys.config.json`, `mlsys-components/`

**Option C: Custom Platform**
- Your own branding/naming scheme
- Example: `dataflow`, `aiplatform`, `mlops`, etc.

### **Step 3: Apply Migration**
```bash
# Preview first (ALWAYS)
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset [CHOICE] --dry-run

# Apply the migration
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset [CHOICE] --apply
```

### **Step 4: Validate & Test**
```bash
# Test the naming system
python scripts/test_naming_system.py

# Test the platform functionality
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Manual validation
./[NEW_CLI_NAME] status
python scripts/evaluation/[NEW_EVAL_CLI].py status
```

### **Step 5: Build New Features**
Once naming is consistent, you can safely:
- Add new evaluation criteria and benchmarks
- Enhance the MLX component ecosystem
- Build platform integrations
- Add monitoring and analytics

## üìÅ Key Files to Understand

### **Core Naming System**
- `scripts/naming_config.py` - Configuration management
- `scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py` - Platform migration tool
- `scripts/evaluation/migrate_naming.py` - Evaluation-specific migration

### **Existing Platform**
- `mlsys` - Main CLI script (may be renamed)
- `mlx.config.json` - Platform configuration (may be renamed)
- `scripts/evaluation/` - AI evaluation system
- `src/` - User-facing platform code
- `docs/` - Platform documentation

## üö® Critical Success Factors

### **1. Don't Break Existing Functionality**
- Always use `--dry-run` first
- Test thoroughly after migration
- Have backup/rollback plan

### **2. Maintain Backward Compatibility**
- Update all documentation
- Consider deprecation notices for old names
- Update any external references

### **3. Validate the Choice**
- Choose naming that aligns with platform vision
- Consider user expectations and branding
- Ensure consistency across all touchpoints

## üéâ Expected Outcomes

After completing your implementation, the platform should have:

‚úÖ **Consistent naming** across all 33+ files  
‚úÖ **Zero naming inconsistencies** (verified by tests)  
‚úÖ **Enhanced functionality** building on the solid foundation  
‚úÖ **Improved user experience** with coherent branding  
‚úÖ **Production-ready system** with comprehensive testing  

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with the naming migration** - it's foundational to everything else
2. **Use the existing test suite** - it's comprehensive and will catch issues
3. **Leverage the rich CLI tools** - they provide detailed feedback
4. **Document your choices** - future developers will thank you
5. **Think about the user experience** - consistent naming reduces confusion

## üîó Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Understand the current state
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py analyze | head -50

# See what files would be affected  
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py discover

# Test the system works
python scripts/test_naming_system.py

# When ready, pick your strategy and apply it:
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset mlx --apply
# OR
python scripts/migrate_platform_naming.py set-preset mlsys --apply
```
