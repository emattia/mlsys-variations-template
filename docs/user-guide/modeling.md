# Modeling

> "All models are wrong, but some are useful." — George E. P. Box

Planned contents:

1. Choosing appropriate model architectures.
2. Hyper-parameter management with Hydra.
3. Tracking experiments and metrics.
4. Saving and versioning models (`models/trained/`).
5. Integration with evaluation workflows.

> **TODO** – add detailed guidance and examples.
