# Data Processing

> "Data is the new oil." — Clive Humby

This section will cover:

1. Raw → processed data pipeline structure.
2. Recommended folder conventions (`data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, etc.).
3. Example workflow script (`workflows/data_processing.py`).
4. Tips for reproducibility & versioning.

> **TODO** – flesh out with concrete examples once the final pipeline is defined.
