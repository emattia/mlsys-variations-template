# ADR-002: Temporal for Workflow Orchestration

## Status
Accepted (2025-06-23)

## Context

ML workflows require sophisticated orchestration capabilities:

1. **Durability**: Workflows can run for hours/days and must survive system failures
2. **Complex Dependencies**: DAG execution with conditional logic and error handling
3. **Distributed Execution**: Steps run across different services and compute resources
4. **Observability**: Detailed tracking of workflow state and execution history
5. **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry policies for transient failures
6. **Human Intervention**: Ability to pause, modify, and resume workflows

Existing solutions had significant limitations:
- **Airflow**: Heavy infrastructure, poor programmatic interface
- **Prefect**: Limited durability guarantees, complex deployment
- **Kubernetes Jobs**: No workflow state management, poor error handling
- **Custom Solutions**: High development cost, reliability concerns

## Decision

We adopt **Temporal** as the workflow orchestration engine for the MLX platform.

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Workflow Definition**: Python-based workflow definitions using Temporal SDK
2. **Activity Integration**: Plugin operations executed as Temporal activities
3. **State Management**: Temporal handles all workflow state persistence
4. **Error Handling**: Built-in retry policies with exponential backoff
5. **Observability**: Native integration with OpenTelemetry tracing

### Architecture Integration
```python
@workflow.defn
class MLTrainingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, config: TrainingConfig) -> ModelArtifacts:
        # Plugin execution via activities
        data = await workflow.execute_activity(
            plugin_activity,
            PluginRequest("snowflake", "extract_data", config.data_source),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=2)
        )

        model = await workflow.execute_activity(
            plugin_activity,
            PluginRequest("databricks", "train_model", data),
            retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_attempts=3)
        )

        return model
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Apache Airflow
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, rich UI, extensive integrations
- **Cons**: Heavy infrastructure, DAG-only model, poor programmatic interface
- **Rejected**: Too heavyweight, limited flexibility for ML use cases

### 2. Prefect
- **Pros**: Python-first, good developer experience, modern architecture
- **Cons**: Newer ecosystem, durability concerns, deployment complexity
- **Rejected**: Durability requirements not fully met

### 3. Kubernetes CronJobs/Jobs
- **Pros**: Native to K8s, simple model, good resource management
- **Cons**: No workflow state, poor error handling, limited observability
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for complex ML workflows

### 4. AWS Step Functions
- **Pros**: Serverless, good AWS integration, visual workflow editor
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited local development, JSON-based definitions
- **Rejected**: Vendor lock-in concerns

### 5. Custom Workflow Engine
- **Pros**: Perfect fit for requirements, full control
- **Cons**: High development cost, reliability risks, maintenance burden
- **Rejected**: Not core competency, high risk

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Durability**: Workflows survive system failures and restarts
2. **Reliability**: Built-in retry logic and error handling
3. **Observability**: Rich execution history and real-time monitoring
4. **Scalability**: Handles thousands of concurrent workflows
5. **Developer Experience**: Python-native workflow definitions
6. **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all workflow events
7. **Testing**: Easy to unit test workflow logic
8. **Versioning**: Safe workflow definition updates

### Negative
1. **Infrastructure Complexity**: Requires Temporal cluster deployment
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers must learn Temporal concepts
3. **Dependency**: Critical dependency on Temporal service availability
4. **Resource Overhead**: Additional infrastructure costs
5. **Debugging Complexity**: Distributed workflow debugging can be challenging

### Risk Mitigation
1. **High Availability**: Deploy Temporal cluster with proper redundancy
2. **Training**: Comprehensive developer training on Temporal concepts
3. **Monitoring**: Robust monitoring of Temporal cluster health
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backup of workflow execution history
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Fallback mechanisms for Temporal unavailability

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Deploy Temporal cluster in development environment
2. **Phase 2**: Implement basic workflow patterns and plugin integration
3. **Phase 3**: Add advanced features (schedules, signals, queries)
4. **Phase 4**: Production deployment with monitoring and alerting
