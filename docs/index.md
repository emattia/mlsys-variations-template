# Analysis Template

A streamlined, modern data science project template with best practices for reproducibility, code quality, and collaboration.

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the Analysis Template for data science projects. The template is designed to help you:

- Organize your code and data effectively
- Ensure reproducibility of your analyses
- Maintain high code quality
- Collaborate efficiently with team members
- Document your work thoroughly

## Features

- **Modern Python Setup**: Uses `uv` for dependency management and `pyproject.toml` for configuration
- **Code Quality**: Integrated with `ruff`, `mypy`, and pre-commit hooks
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing setup with `pytest` for both code and workflows
- **Documentation**: Notebook documentation with `nbdoc`
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing
- **Data Processing**: Example workflows for data processing and analysis
- **Reproducibility**: Environment management and configuration

## Getting Started

To get started with the template, see the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.
